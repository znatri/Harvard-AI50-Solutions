# Harvard AI50 Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for Harvard University's [AI50: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/) course. The course covers a variety of topics in artificial intelligence, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, probabilistic inference, reinforcement learning, and machine learning.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into six weeks, with each week focusing on different aspects of AI. Each week includes lecture videos, notes, and problem sets. The problem sets consist of a variety of programming assignments and quizzes.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by week, with each folder corresponding to a specific week's problem set:

|-- week0

|-- week1

|-- week2

|-- week3

|-- week4

|-- week5

|-- LICENSE

|-- README.md

Each week's folder contains the relevant source code, data files, and a README.md file with a brief description of the assignments and any additional notes.

These solutions are provided for educational purposes only. Please do not use them to complete your own coursework. It is important to learn and understand the material by working through the problem sets independently.
